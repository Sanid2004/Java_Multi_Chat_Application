   Here , I have tried to establish a multi - chat Application in Java.

   
   ->Multiple Clients can enter the chat at a given time.

   
   ->Whenever a client gets added server notifies about it , to other clients

   
   ->Client can send messages to other clients.

   
   ->Whenever a client leaves the chat , server notifies about it to other clients
